This project was built to help me manage my daily life more efficiently. It includes several modules for different aspects of personal management.

## Features

- **Finance Tracker:** Keep track of income and expenses.
- **Task Manager:** Create, edit, and prioritize tasks.
- **Habit Tracker:** Build and monitor daily habits.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts for better insights.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js:** For server-side rendering and routing.
- **Recoil:** For state management.
- **Supabase:** As the backend database and authentication service.
- **Chart.js:** For displaying data in charts.

I learned a lot about integrating different services and managing complex application state while building this project.
